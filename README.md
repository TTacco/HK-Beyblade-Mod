# HK-Beyblade-Mod
Dumb Hollow Knight mod that gives you an infinite Cyclone Spin while still being able to use movement abilities and spell
(Essentially you have a protective aura/halo/whatever around you all the time)

Enable by either casting Cyclone or Great Slash normally (Hence Great Slash is disabled).

Disable by casting either again.

Notes:
- Has no damage changes to nail arts whatsoever
- (WIP) Player, regardless if either he has Nailmasters Glory equipped or not, will have no difference in charge speed, so dont bother.
- (WIP) Cyclone and Great Slash are not given to the player on the start, so they must own them first in order to use them
